    <u><h1>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h1> </u>
    
    <h2>Picking a Website</h2>

    <b>Website to Redesign</b>: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ <br>
    <img src="website.jpg" width="1200" height="600"> <br>

    <h2>Finding Problems</h2>
    <b>Usability</b>: Is it easy to understand and use? (for all users) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Partpicker interface seems pretty straight forward</li>
      <li>Users can browse for each part of a PC separately</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Learnability</b>: Is it easy to learn? (for new users) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>For a new user building his or her first PC, the partpicker interface may be intimidating</li>
      <li>Pictures and a short description of each part would make a more welcoming interface</li>
    </ul>




    <b>Memorability</b>: Is it easy to recall what to do? (for casual users) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Because the partpicker interface's usability is great due to its simplicity, memorability is also a strength of this interface</li>
      <li>Pictures and short descriptions of each part will also help memorability along with learnability of the partpicker interface</li>
    </ul>




    <b>Efficiency</b>: Can typical tasks be done quickly? (for frequent users) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Partpicker interface's biggest weakness is how long it takes for users to browse for each part</li>
      <li>All blue buttons link to a completely different page with a list of its corresponding PC part. Then, selecting a model will bring the 
        user back to this page. A dropdown menu with some of the top rated models for each PC part will increase efficiency 
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Acessibility</h2>
    The website did not display any major accessibility concerns. All text and interfaces such as buttons and links were easily visible and <br>
    able to be identified. VoiceOver on the MacOS also had no trouble reading all text on the PCPartpicker website line by line left to right. 
    


    <u><h1>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h1> </u>

    <h2>Low-fi Wireframing (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)</h2>

    <div>
      <img src="Desktop.png" height="400px">
      <img src="Tablet.png" height="400px">
      <img src="Mobile.png" height="400px">
    </div>

    <h2>Hi-fi Prototyping (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)</h2>

    <div>
      <img src="Desktop2.png" height="400px">
      <img src="Tablet2.png" height="400px" width="500px">
      <img src="Mobile2.png" height="400px" width="400px">
    </div>

    <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>

    <u><h1>Part 3: Responsive Redesign</h1></u>

    <div>
      <img src="finished webpage.png" height="600px">
      <P>
        The responsive webpage accomodated the Desktop and Tablet resolutions with ease, but it struggled to resize navigation bar when set to the iPhoneX resolution. <br>
        The website looked best in English regular size text but shared same functionality in other languages and in other sizes of text. Website had no problems in terms of accessibility.
      </P>
